```{r load-source, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Set working directory FIRST

# Load Source Script
This includes all library imports, data imports/setup/cleaning, and plot functions.
The data has been set up to filter to only patients who have had at least one "2R+" ACR event.
ACR status variables have been defined in the source script as well for 1)non-log2 data visualizations, 2)log2 statistical analyses, and 3)classification of pre-2R, active-2R, post-2R samples arranged by POD

```{r load-source}
source("Immunosuppressive metabolites feature table/Scripts/00_source")
```

# Patient-Level Analysis of Immunosuppressive Metabolites

## In ALL patients, compare patients who NEVER had 2R+ vs patients who HAD at least one 2R+ episode (using all patients in the dataset)
```{r}


```

### In ALL patients, compare NEVER 2R+ vs HAD 2R+ but exclude samples taken during active 2R+ episodes and post-2R+

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Source the script
source("Immunosuppressive metabolites feature table/Scripts/05c_PatientLevel_BaselineOnly")

# Display the volcano plot
knitr::include_graphics("Immunosuppressive metabolites feature table/Results/PatientLevel_5c_BaselineOnly/baseline_patient_volcano_plot.png")
```

## Within patients who experienced rejection (at least one event of "2R+"), compare pre-2R vs post-2R samples (0R/1R samples vs 2R+ samples)
